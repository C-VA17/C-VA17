# Hi 👋, I'm Sivarajan  
### A passionate beginner eager to dive into the world of Data Science.

👷‍♂️ I'm a **Test Engineer** with over **six years of experience** in the **Plastic Manufacturing industry** near **Senai, Johor**.

🎓 I hold a **Bachelor's degree in Petroleum Engineering**. I pivoted into manufacturing due to the oil & gas industry's downturn during my graduating year.

🔍 Over the years, I’ve gained valuable insights into **testing**, **quality control**, and **process analysis**.

🚀 After six years in the industry, I began seeking new challenges and discovered **Data Science** a field that aligns with my **analytical skills** and passion for **problem-solving**.

📚 I'm currently pursuing a **Master’s in Data Science**, committed to learning **data analysis**, **machine learning**, and **programming**.

🛠️ While I don’t have formal coding experience yet, I’m actively building up my skill set and am excited to apply my background in problem-solving to real-world data-driven challenges.
